## Introduction

This document provides step-by-step instructions to configure the project for development, testing, and production environments.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Installed the required software dependencies
- Set up the necessary hardware (if any)
- Acquired access to required third-party services

## Configuration Files

### Main Configuration File

The main configuration file contains settings that are crucial for the project's operation. Here is how to set it up:

1. Locate the main configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`, `config.json`).
2. Edit the file to include your specific settings.

Example (`config.yaml`):

```yaml
database:
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  username: your_username
  password: your_password

server:
  port: 8080
  environment: development
